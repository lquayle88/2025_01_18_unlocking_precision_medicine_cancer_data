# Unlocking Precision Medicine: Advanced Survival Analysis Tools for Cancer Biomarker Validation

## Repository Overview
This repository focuses on the initial phase of the "Unlocking Precision Medicine: Advanced Survival Analysis Tools for Cancer Biomarker Validation" project. It encompasses data retrieval, cleaning, and exploratory analysis processes for gene expression and clinical datasets related to the "big four" cancers: breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal. The curated datasets and scripts here lay the groundwork for the development of our survival analysis tools and biomarker validation methods.

## Contents
- **Source**: R scripts for data extraction, preprocessing, and cleaning.
- **Data**: Curated datasets for the "big four" cancers.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on data sources, preprocessing steps, and exploratory analysis methods.
- **Outputs**: Cleaned datasets, tumour compendia, and exploratory visualisations.

## Key Objectives
1. Extract and preprocess open-access gene expression and clinical datasets.
2. Perform structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) to characterise the datasets.
3. Create a tumour compendium for each of the four most prevalent cancer types.
4. Ensure the cleaned datasets are suitable for downstream survival analysis and biomarker validation.

## Data Sources
This repository utilises publicly available datasets, including transcriptomic and clinical data from trusted repositories. Details on specific data sources and their licensing are provided in the `documentation/data_sources.md` file.
